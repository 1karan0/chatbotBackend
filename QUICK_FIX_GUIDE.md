# Quick Fix Guide - SQLite & ChromaDB

## TL;DR - What Was Fixed

Your application had two issues:
1. ❌ ChromaDB couldn't initialize because of SQLite incompatibility
2. ❌ PostgreSQL settings weren't loading from .env

Both are now fixed ✓

## What Changed

### 1. Dependencies Updated
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Added `pysqlite3-binary` for ChromaDB compatibility
- Updated ChromaDB to version 0.4.22

### 2. Code Updates
- SQLite module replacement added to all files that use ChromaDB
- PostgreSQL settings now load properly from `.env`

### 3. New Files
- `verify_setup.py` - Checks if everything works
- `SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Detailed instructions
- `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - Full technical details

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (if not already done)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Verify everything works
python verify_setup.py

# 3. Start the application
python main.py
```

That's it! Your application should now work properly.

## What Each Database Does

```
PostgreSQL          ChromaDB
├── Users          ├── Vector embeddings
├── Tenants        ├── Semantic search
└── Knowledge      └── AI retrieval
    Sources
```

- **PostgreSQL**: Stores your application data (users, tenants, etc.)
- **ChromaDB**: Stores vector embeddings for AI-powered search (uses SQLite internally for metadata)

## If You See Errors

### "No module named 'pysqlite3'"
```bash
pip install pysqlite3-binary
```

### "PostgreSQL connection failed"
Check your `.env` file has:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
PG_USER=charbot_user
PG_PASSWORD=...
```

### ChromaDB errors
```bash
# Delete and recreate
rm -rf ./chroma_db
python main.py
```

## Verify It Works

```bash
python verify_setup.py
```

Should see all ✓ checks passing.

## API Endpoints

Once running, visit:
- http://localhost:8000/docs (API documentation)
- http://localhost:8000/health (Health check)

## Need More Info?

- `SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Detailed setup instructions
- `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - Technical details of all changes
- `README.md` - Full application documentation

## Support

The application is now configured to:
✓ Use PostgreSQL for application data
✓ Use ChromaDB for vector search (with compatible SQLite)
✓ Handle both databases without conflicts

Everything should work out of the box!
